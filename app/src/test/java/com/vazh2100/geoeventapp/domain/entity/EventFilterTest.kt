/**
 * Unit tests for the event filtering functionality in the EventRepository.
 * This test class focuses on validating the filtering of events based on different criteria:
 * 1. Event type (e.g., CONCERT, SPORTING_EVENT)
 * 2. Radius from the user's location
 * 3. Start date of the event
 * 4. End date of the event
 * 5. Combined filtering by type and radius
 * 6. No filters applied, returning all events.
 * The tests are designed to ensure that the `getFilteredEvents` method behaves as expected when
 * filtering events based on one or more criteria.

 * Dependencies:
 * - Koin for dependency injection.
 * - MockK for mocking and spying on methods.
 * - Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous testing.

 * The test class initializes a mock `EventRepository`, mocks the `getAllEvents` method, and provides
 * a predefined list of events to test the filtering logic.
